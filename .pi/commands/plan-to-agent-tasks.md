description: Convert a refined plan to agents tasks
hardness: pi:opus-4.5
---

Read the entire plan at $@ ,and elaborate on it more and then create a comprehensive and granular set of `agent-tasks` for all this with tasks, subtasks, and dependency structure overlaid, with detailed comments so that the whole thing is totally self-contained and self-documenting (including relevant background, reasoning/justification, considerations, etc.-- anything we'd want our "future self" to know about the goals and intentions and thought process and how it serves the over-arching goals of the project.)  Use only the `tk` tool to create and modify the `agent-tasks` and add the dependencies. Use ultrathink.   

Run `tk --help` for more information.
