description: Review and improve agent tasks
hardness: pi:opus-4.5

Check over each `agent-task` that we created with `tk` super carefully -- are you sure it makes sense? Is it optimal? Could we change anything to make the system work better for users? If so, revise the `agent-tasks`. It's a lot easier and faster to operate in "plan space" before we start implementing these things! Use ultrathink.
